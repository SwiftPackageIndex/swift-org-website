Swift has a rich ecosystem of open-source packages that you can easily import into your project using the [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) (SPM). Use the [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com) to search for libraries and tools that are compatible with SPM.
