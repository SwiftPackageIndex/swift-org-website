Swift has a rich ecosystem of open source packages that you can easily import into your project using the [Swift Package Manager]({% link package-manager/index.md %}) (SwiftPM).

There are thousands of packages to help with networking, testing, building user interfaces, logging, animation, and many more tasks across all of your projects. You can also [create your own package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-a-standalone-swift-package-with-xcode) for personal use, for private use within your organisation, or as an open source library to share with others.
